\section{Related Work}

A recent study from Carnegie Mellon University\cite{bogart15-break}, consists of seven interviews
with package maintainers of packages in CRAN (R) and Node.js (Javascript). A
joint problem seems to be that it is too complicated to follow breaking changes
in dependent libraries. Even though that Node.js has semantic versioning, a
Node.js developer claims the technique is not uniformly applied. The study
concludes that tools has to be created that are able to, more concisely, inform
developers about breaking changes, and let them reason about the stability of a
library.

Automatic semantic versioning has been efficiently used in Elm. Elm is a
functional and static typed language which makes semantic versioning simple. In
Elm the version numbers is defined like this: a patch is never changing the
API, a minor version added stuff to the API, and major version changed or
removed values in the API. The API in Elm is defined as all exposed values,
which is both constants and functions, in all exposed modules. In Elm,
everything not specified by the type is considered a secret.  That could be an
under approximation because some behavior might be expected, but is not
specified in the types. 
 
In his seminal work on Delta Debugging, Zeller writes ``The GDB people have done
it again. The new release 4.17 of the GNU debugger brings several new features,
languages, and platforms, but for some reason, it no longer integrates properly
with my graphical front-end DDD: the arguments specified within DDD are not
passed to the debugged program. Something has changed within GDB such that it
no longer works for me. Something? Between the 4.16 and 4.17 releases, no less
than 178,000 lines have changed. How can I isolate the change that caused the
failure and make GDB work again?''

Delta Debugging aims to locate the change that caused the failure. If GDB is
following semantic versioning, there are two possible explanations; It's GDB's
fault: GDB published a minor version upgrade with a breaking change, violating
SEMVER; or It's DDD's fault: DDD unwittingly relied on (unspecified) secrets of
GDB. In either case, our tool would detect who was at fault and localize the
error. Further, it would help the GDB developers avoid releasing breaking
changes, and would help the DDD developers avoid relying on the secrets of GDB.

When our cross-version testing approach detects a SemVer violation,
the library authors will need to know which change(s) caused the
violation. In such cases, we can apply change-impact analysis
\cite{Stoerzer} to detect which changes from library version A induced
failures in the cross-version tests. Stoerzer et al. \cite{Stoerzer}
developed a change classification technique that classifies changes
that affect a failing test by their likelyhood to have induced the
failure. This would help developers focus their attention on the
changes most likely to have caused the SemVer
violation. Alternatively, it could help developers quickly factor out
a SemVer-compliant release within their deadline.
