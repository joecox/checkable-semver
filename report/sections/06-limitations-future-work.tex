\section{Limitations and Future Work}
One limitation of our approach is that refactoring assertions about
API secrets out of API tests can result in duplicated testing
code. This might be avoided by using a more complex test design, but
that could reducing the readability of test, making them less useful
as specifications.

We expected to find some interface tests that could not be effectively
refactored to remove API secrets. We did not find any such tests, but
the small scope of our study prevents us from making any conclusions
about the likelyhood of this scenario in practice.
