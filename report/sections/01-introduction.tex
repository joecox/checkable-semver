\section{Introduction}

% Problem setup / Motivation
It has always been difficult to rigorously specify library interfaces.
Interfaces are often defined with text, which is often incomplete and not
machine checkable, or, for some programming languages with types, which are
often incomplete. Machine checkability is important as it prevents
documentation from going stale. Completeness is important, as incompleteness
will lead to ambiguity and ambiguity leads to losses; either in the terms of
wrong assumptions made by the client, or some features goes unused. These
problems are only taking one version of the interface into account. When
looking at the evolution of an interface, it is harder still to ensure that the
interface does not introduce a breaking change unexpectedly. Semantic Version, or
SemVer, helps library authors define the scope of their changes solely through
the version number. However, authors can and often do violate SemVer. For
example, an author may make a backwards incompatible change but only increment
the minor version. Library consumers observing the version number will not
expect the change and systems will break. 

% Motivating examples
Sass is a widely used style language which compiles to Css. The project
contains of two side running targets Sass and LibSass. LibSass is a 
faster C++ implementation of Sass, and is supposed to conform to Sass. The
problem happened when LibSass rolled back a feature in a minor version (3.5). 
They felt that they could do this because it was a bug in Sass. Many people 
viewed this as breaking change, and Sass ended up to apologies. This situation
would not have happened if the interface where testable, as LibSass would have
been forced to adhered with the same specification as Sass\cite{libsass}. 
%

% Motivation of solution
A better way of defining interfaces is needed. Even though specification
languages do exist, they have not gained traction in the real world. A very
practical way of giving guarantees in dynamic languages is testing.  Many
libraries have unit tests, regression tests, integration tests, and more.
However, any given test may test the library interface, internal
implementation, or both.  The tests that test only the library interface are
interface tests. In most libraries, they will be hiding among other tests.  Our
solution is to use test to specify the interface, and explicitly hold them
separated from the other tests. These tests both will have dual purpose. They
give clear examples to the clients of expected usage, and they grantee that
library upholds interface. We define that the test specification is a complete
specification. If the specification differ from the library's developers idea,
the developer is wrong.  A library succeeding the interface specification does
therefor by definition not contain bugs, only undocumented features. This
distinction will enable us to give stronger guarantees about the library, but
will also lead to some confounding factors which we discuss in detail.

% Contribution
The goal of this paper is to solve the problem of incoherent and
incomplete interfaces. To that end we have defined an interface specification
as the collection of tests that only tests the interface of the library. We have
shown that we can give valuable guarantees, both to the user of the library and
the library developers them selves, not only in one version of the library but 
over a history of releases. To give a direct application of the interfaces 
specifications, we have created a tool that given a history of releases can
predict if a release contains SemVer violations.

% Layout of the report. 
The rest of the article is parted into 6 sections. Besides the introduction, we
have; 
\begin{itemize}

    \item a related work section that covers the state of the art in in terms
    of interface specifications, and version history mining; 

    \item an approach section, which defines how to use tests to specify
    interfaces and how to use these interfaces to detect SemVer violations;

    \item an evaluation, which describes the empirical studies we have
    performed to address some of confounding factors;

    \item the results section, which contains the results of the studies and a
    overall discussion of confounding factors;

    \item and lastly a conclusion, wrapping up the paper and presenting the
    lessons learned.

\end{itemize}

%We create a tool that can identify SemVer violations given a code
%repository, its testing framework, and a version history.  Our tool will apply
%tests appearing in each version of a repository to later versions of the code.
%Tests that succeed in an earlier version but fail in a later version are
%candidates for SemVer violations.  We will manually identify tests that are
%interface tests and the tool will further compare test behavior against
%versioning.  For example, if an interface test succeeds in an earlier version
%but fails in a subsequent minor update, then SemVer has been violated.  
%
%Thus, a library author can use our tool to detect potential SemVer violations
%by testing previous versions tests against the code the author is about to
%commit. Our tool will detect any SemVer violations and give the author the
%choice to either revert the API changes or push a major update.
